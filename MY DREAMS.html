		so I could make some effort to the bad things that Idid just to pay back and show them how sorry I am for being
		a stubborn daughter I wish that I could send my parents in Macca to perform hajj because it's my father's greatest
		wish. And lastly I wish that all of my dreams will come true when it is in Allah's will </h2><CENTER>
